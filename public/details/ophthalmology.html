    <hr>
    Ophthalmology is the study of medical conditions relating to the eye. Ophthalmologists are doctors who specialize in the medical and surgical treatment of this organ.

A general practice doctor may refer someone to an ophthalmologist if they show symptoms of cataracts, eye infections, optic nerve problems, or other eye conditions.

In this article, we look at what ophthalmologists do, including the types of conditions that they treat, the procedures they perform, and when a person might see this specialist.
    <hr>

    Subspecialist ophthalmologists have usually completed training that allows them to work on eye conditions that are complex, involve a specific part of the eye, or affect certain groups of people. They also train more extensively than regular ophthalmologists to perform extremely intricate surgeries on delicate parts of the eye.

<h3>Conditions they treat</h3>
Ophthalmologists are responsible for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of almost all eye conditions and visual issues.

However, subspecialist ophthalmologists tend to treat and monitor certain conditions, such as:
<ul>
<li>glaucoma
<li>retinal conditions, such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy
<li>corneal conditions
<li>cataracts
<li>cases involving children or childhood eye conditions
<li>cases with a neurological cause or component, such as optic nerve problems, abnormal eye movements, double vision, and some kinds of vision loss
<li>cases involving complex surgical procedures, such as reconstructive surgery or advanced vision repair
</ul>
Aside from caring for the eyes and vision, an ophthalmologistâ€™s medical training may also equip them to notice symptoms of conditions that do not directly relate to the eye. In such cases, they can refer people for the appropriate treatment.

Many ophthalmologists also participate in some form of scientific research focusing on the causes of eye and vision conditions, as well as potential cures.
