    <hr>
    Gynecology and obstetrics are twin subjects that deal with the female reproductive system. While obstetrics deals with pregnancy and its associated procedures and complications, gynaecology involves treating women who are not pregnant.

The field of obstetrics thus deals with the wellbeing of the pregnant mother as well as the delivery and healthy outcome.

Obstetricians closely work with the paediatricians and neonatologists to deal with care of the newborn baby to reduce the chances of mortality and disease of the newborn.

    <h3>Training required</h3>
    To become a qualified obstetrician, both obstetrics and gynaecology are chosen as specialism subjects.

A degree in medicine followed by two years of training is required. This is then followed by postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology.
