    Radiology is a branch of medicine that uses imaging technology to diagnose and treat disease.

Radiology may be divided into two different areas, diagnostic radiology and interventional radiology. Doctors who specialize in radiology are called radiologists.

    <h3>Definition</h3>
    Radiology is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases within the bodies of animals and humans.

A variety of imaging techniques such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography (PET), fluoroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to diagnose or treat diseases. Interventional radiology is the performance of usually minimally invasive medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies such as those mentioned above.

Diagnostic radiology helps health care providers see structures inside your body. Doctors that specialize in the interpretation of these images are called diagnostic radiologists. Using the diagnostic images, the radiologist or other physicians can often:
<ul>
<li>Diagnose the cause of your symptoms
<li>Monitor how well your body is responding to a treatment you are receiving for your disease or condition
<li>Screen for different illnesses, such as breast cancer, colon cancer, or heart disease
</ul>
