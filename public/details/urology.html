    <hr>
    Urology is a part of health care that deals with diseases of the male and female urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). It also deals with the male organs that are able to make babies (penis, testes, scrotum, prostate, etc.).

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    Urology (from Greek οὖρον ouron "urine" and -λογία -logia "study of"), also known as genitourinary surgery, is the branch of medicine that focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the male and female urinary-tract system and the male reproductive organs.

<h3>Types</h3>
Urology is known as a surgical specialty. Besides surgery, a urologist is a doctor with wisdom of internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and other parts of health care. This is because a urologist encounters a wide range of clinical problems. The scope of urology is big and the American Urological Association has named seven subspecialty parts:
<ul>
<li>Pediatric Urology (children's urology)
<li>Urologic Oncology (urologic cancers)
<li>Renal (kidney) Transplant
<li>Male Infertility
<li>Calculi (urinary tract stones)
<li>Female Urology
<li>Neurourology (nervous system control of genitourinary organs)
</ul>
